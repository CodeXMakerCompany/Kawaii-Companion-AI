# **Kawaii Companion AI**  

In a world where AI is set to dominate industries, we need a *kawaii* companion that:  
- Helps us deliver quality experiences.  
- Deepens our involvement in business processes daily.  
- Recognizes requirements and trains our fundamentals and languages.  
- Evolves into the ultimate tool for developers.  

Welcome to **AI Developer NEXTGEN**—the future of development is in our hands. We are ready to scale to the next era, where every developer is empowered by AI tools that truly understand their needs. Feel free to contribute to this project—let’s build something special together! 💖

   - Download and install.  
   - **Requirements:** Enable API support (local mode) in the program settings.  

### 3. **[Ollama LLM](https://ollama.com/library/llama3.1)**  
   - Use version 3.1 or set it up as needed.  

### 4. **[TTS - Silero](https://github.com/snakers4/silero-models)**  
   - The best free TTS model for CPU.  

### 5. **[Selenium](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/#stable)**
